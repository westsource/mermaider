## Features

### Code Editing
- **Syntax Highlighting** - Mermaid syntax highlighting with line numbers via a custom `MermaidHighlightingProvider`
- **Multi-tab** - Edit multiple files independently with automatic tab switching; each tab has a close button; tab close confirmation for unsaved changes with Save/Don't Save/Cancel dialog
- **Debounced Rendering** - Auto-renders after 350ms of inactivity to avoid excessive refreshes
- **Context Menu** - Full right-click context menu in the code editor: Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste, Select All, with keyboard shortcuts
- **Close Tab Confirmation** - Closing an unsaved tab prompts Save / Don't Save / Cancel; on app exit, all modified tabs are prompted

### Real-time Preview
- **JavaScript Injection Updates** - Initial load via WebView file navigation; subsequent updates use `ExecuteScriptAsync` to inject JavaScript directly, bypassing file caching and navigation issues
- **Global renderDiagram Function** - The `renderDiagram(code)` function is exposed globally for zero-latency script injection updates
- **Drag to Pan** - Hold left mouse button and drag to move the diagram
- **Scroll to Zoom** - Zoom from 0.2x to 30x via mouse wheel (zoom centers on cursor position); zoom level displayed in status bar
- **Double-click to Fit** - Auto-fit diagram to viewport on double-click
- **Error Display** - User-friendly error messages shown directly in the preview area when diagram syntax is invalid
- **Zoom Controls** - Zoom In, Zoom Out, Reset Zoom commands available
- **Status Bar** - Bottom bar shows status messages and current zoom percentage
- **Toggle Editor** - Click the triangle button (▶/◀) in the splitter bar to hide/show the editor for full-screen preview
- **Rendering Cache** - LRU cache (32 entries max) + background PNG generation after preview

### Image Operations
- **Save Image** - Click the floating Save button (top-right corner of preview area) to export a high-resolution PNG image
- **Copy Image** - Click the floating Copy button (top-right corner of preview area) to copy diagram to system clipboard as PNG
- **Adaptive Scaling** - Export automatically calculates the optimal scale (1.5x–5.0x) based on diagram complexity (element count: nodes, edges, subgraphs)

### File Operations
- Create / Open / Save Mermaid files (.mmd / .mermaid)
- Command-line argument support for opening files
- Recent files history (up to 10 files)
- Save confirmation dialog with Save/Don't Save/Cancel when closing unsaved tabs
- Unsaved change detection on application exit, prompting for each modified file
- Close Current Tab with Ctrl+W

### AI Assistant

- **Model Selector** - Dropdown in the AI input area to quickly switch between configured models
- **One-click Apply** - Apply AI-generated code to the editor instantly, with "Revert" to undo
- **Conversation History** - Persisted to disk per-file (keyed by file path hash), supports continuous multi-turn conversations; storage path configurable
- **Configurable Parameters** - Temperature, MaxTokens, and other settings configurable per model
- **Selectable Messages** - Chat message text (including code) is selectable and copyable
- **Multi-line Input** - Shift+Enter for newline, Enter to send
- **Draggable Splitter** - Adjustable-height splitter between chat history and input area
- **Input Box Context Menu** - Right-click context menu: Cut/Copy/Paste/SelectAll
- **Settings Icon (⚙)** - Opens AI Settings dialog to manage models, API keys, and conversation storage path
- **API Key Security** - API keys stored encrypted via AES, separate from main settings

### Settings
- **Language Switching** - File → Settings → Language submenu; dynamically switch between available languages (en-US, zh-CN). System language auto-detected on first launch
- **AI Model Management** - File → Settings → AI Settings opens a full configuration dialog for adding, editing, and deleting AI model configs:
  - Name, Provider (OpenAI / Azure OpenAI / Ollama / Custom)
  - API Key, Base URL, Model ID
  - Max Tokens (default 4096), Temperature (default 0.7)
- **Conversation Storage Path** - Configurable directory for AI conversation history files
- **Auto-save Layout** - Editor/preview ratio, preview zoom, AI panel state (expanded/collapsed), AI panel height, and other settings automatically saved to `%APPDATA%/Mermaider/settings.json`

### Update

### About
- **Help → About** - Displays application name, description, author (黄超/道荣), and current version
- **Help → Mermaid Documentation** - Opens `https://mermaid.js.org/intro/` in the default web browser

### UI Features
- **Draggable Splitter** - Editor/preview ratio adjustable via drag (editor min 320px, max 860px; preview min 480px)
- **Built-in Toggle Button** - Triangle button (▶/◀) in the splitter bar to hide/show the editor
- **Fluent Theme** - Modern UI style
- **Auto-save Layout** - Editor ratio, zoom level, AI panel state, and other settings auto-saved
- **Status Bar** - Status messages and zoom percentage displayed at bottom
- **Tab Close Button** - Each tab has a close "×" button

### Technical Details
- Preview uses `CoreWebView2.ExecuteScriptAsync` for JavaScript injection, bypassing file:// URL caching and navigation restrictions
- AI configuration Base URL is automatically sanitized (removes trailing `/chat/completions` or `/v1/chat/completions`)
- Preview temporary files are cleaned up by creation time (only keep last 7 days)
- **Rendering Cache**: LRU cache (32 entries max) caches rendered PNG images by content hash (SHA256)
- **Background PNG Generation**: After validation, a background task generates high-quality PNG at adaptive scale for save/copy
- **Secure Storage**: API keys stored encrypted (AES) in a separate `secure.config` file
- **Adaptive Export Scale**: Scale calculated based on diagram element count (1.5x for simple, up to 5.0x for complex)
